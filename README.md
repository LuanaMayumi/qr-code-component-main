## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

With this first project from FrontEnd Mentor, I learned how to start the project using tailwind customization

```html
<script> 
    tailwind.config = {
      theme: {
        extend: {
          colors: {
            "light-gray": "hsl(212, 45%, 89%)",
            "grayish-blue": "hsl(220, 15%, 55%)",
            "dark-blue": "hsl(218, 44%, 22%)",
          },
          fontFamily: {
            "outfit": [
              "Outfit",
              "sans-serif",
            ]
          } 
        }
      }
    }
  </script>
```
And how to apply HTML semantic Tags, styling with tailwind CSS, applying Mobile Firt methodology.


```js
<div class="w-80 h-[500px] mx-auto bg-white p-4 rounded-2xl">
```

### Continued development

I want to improve my tailwind skills to build others projects faster.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com) - This helped me to understand how Tailwind CSS works.
